# -Retail Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail data to derive actionable business insights. The primary aim was to clean and process the data, identify trends, segment customers, and evaluate churn to support strategic decision-making. The project also includes advanced analytics such as time-series analysis and customer segmentation, along with data visualization for effective communication of findings.

Features of the Project
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Merged multiple datasets using customer IDs to create a unified dataset for analysis.

Removed missing values and handled invalid entries for data integrity.

Transformed data types (e.g., transaction dates converted to datetime) to enable smooth operations.

Created additional features such as Month, Year, and Month-Year for time-based analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Uncovered transaction trends and identified top-performing months.

Analyzed customer behavior to identify the highest revenue-generating customers and frequent buyers.

3. Advanced Analytics
Time-Series Analysis: Analyzed monthly revenue trends to uncover seasonal patterns and assist in forecasting.

Customer Segmentation: Implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to group customers into actionable segments based on purchase behaviors.

Churn Analysis: Evaluated customer retention rates and churn factors to inform retention strategies.

4. Data Visualization
Created insightful visualizations including:

Time-series plots to track revenue trends.

Bar plots to analyze top customers by frequency and revenue.

Boxplots for outlier detection in transactional data.

Leveraged Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries for high-quality visuals.
